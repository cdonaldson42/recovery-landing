# Treatment Provider Persona: First-Time Account Creation & Center Claim

## Persona Overview

**Name:** Marcus Chen
**Title:** Executive Director / Owner
**Facility:** New Horizons Wellness Center (18-bed residential)
**Location:** Austin, TX
**Experience:** 12 years as licensed clinical social worker; 2 years as facility owner
**Age:** 44

### Background
Marcus recently opened his own treatment facility after years of working in clinical roles at larger centers. He's clinically strong but newer to the business development side. He's heard about Recovery.com from colleagues at an industry conference and noticed his facility is already listed (from public licensing data) but with incomplete information. He wants to "claim" the listing, correct inaccuracies, and explore what the platform offers. This is his first time creating an account on Recovery.com.

**Technical Comfort:** Moderate. Uses EMR systems daily, comfortable with basic SaaS tools, but not a power user.
**Time Available:** Limited. Wearing multiple hats as owner-operator.
**Budget:** Conservative. Bootstrapped facility, cautious about marketing spend until proven ROI.

---

## Context: Why He's Here Today

1. **A family mentioned they found his facility on Recovery.com** — but the listing showed outdated info (old phone number, missing insurance details)
2. **A competitor in Austin has 47 reviews on the platform** — Marcus has zero
3. **He wants to control his online presence** — concerned about what families see before calling

---

## The Claim & Signup Journey

### Step 1: Searching for His Facility

**What He Does:**
- Goes to Recovery.com
- Searches "New Horizons Wellness Center Austin"
- Finds his facility listed

**What He Sees:**
- Basic listing with facility name, address, phone (incorrect)
- No photos
- No reviews
- "Claim this center" or similar CTA

**Thoughts:**
- *"Okay, we're already in here. Good that families can find us, but this info is wrong."*
- *"No reviews yet. That competitor has 47. We look like we just opened yesterday."*
- *"'Claim this center'—let me see what that involves."*

---

### Step 2: Starting the Claim Process

**What He Expects:**
- Verify he's authorized to manage the listing
- Some form of identity/ownership verification
- Ability to update information immediately (or soon after)

**Concerns:**
- *"How do they verify I actually own this facility? What if someone fraudulently claims us?"*
- *"Is this going to take weeks with back-and-forth emails?"*
- *"Do I need to have documents ready—license, articles of incorporation?"*

**Ideal Experience:**
- Clear explanation of verification methods (phone call to facility, email domain verification, license lookup)
- Estimated timeline for approval
- Ability to start updating info during verification (pending review)

---

### Step 3: Account Creation

**Information He's Willing to Provide:**
- Name, email, phone
- Role/title at facility
- Facility name (already known from listing)

**Information That Gives Him Pause:**
- Credit card before seeing value
- Extensive questionnaires before accessing dashboard
- Marketing preferences/sales opt-ins

**Thoughts During Signup:**
- *"Just let me in to fix our phone number. I'll explore paid features later."*
- *"If this requires a sales call before I can even see the dashboard, I'm out."*
- *"Please don't auto-subscribe me to daily marketing emails."*

**Ideal Experience:**
- Minimal required fields (expand profile later)
- No credit card required for free tier
- Clear opt-in (not opt-out) for marketing communications
- Immediate access to dashboard after email verification

---

### Step 4: First Dashboard Experience (Post-Enrollment Welcome)

After creating his account, Marcus lands on a welcome dashboard. This is the critical moment to sell him on Recovery.com's value and set clear expectations.

---

#### What He Sees: Dashboard Layout

**Section 1: Welcome & Value Proposition**

> **Welcome to Recovery.com, Marcus!**
> You've taken the first step to connecting with families seeking treatment.

**Benefits of Claiming Your Center** (prominently displayed):
| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Leads to Your Inbox** | Qualified inquiries sent directly to your admissions email |
| **Comprehensive Facility Profile** | Showcase your programs, staff, amenities, and success stories |
| **Full Control** | Update your facility details anytime—you own your presence |
| **Nationwide Search Inclusion** | Families across the country can find you when searching for care |

**Marcus's Thoughts:**
- *"Okay, so leads come straight to my admissions email. I don't have to check another dashboard constantly."*
- *"Nationwide search—that's good. We accept out-of-state patients."*
- *"Full control. That's what I need."*

---

**Section 2: What Happens Next (Provider Ambassador Process)**

> **Your Claim is Being Reviewed**
> A Recovery.com Provider Ambassador will review your information to verify your center. This typically takes 1-2 business days.

**What to Expect:**
1. A Provider Ambassador reviews the data you submitted
2. They may contact you to verify details or request documentation
3. Once approved, your claimed profile goes live
4. You'll receive an email confirmation with next steps

**Marcus's Thoughts:**
- *"1-2 business days—that's reasonable. Not instant, but not weeks either."*
- *"Provider Ambassador—sounds like a real person, not just an algorithm."*
- *"They might call to verify. I should make sure the front desk knows."*

**What He Can Do Now:**
- Review the basic data on file
- Prepare photos and content for when the claim is approved
- Explore the portal features

---

**Section 3: Profile & Contact Info (Data Provided)**

A card showing the information currently on file:

> **New Horizons Wellness Center**
> 1847 Recovery Lane, Austin, TX 78701
> Phone: (512) 555-0123 *(He notices this is wrong)*
> Website: www.newhorizonswellness.com
> Admissions Email: admissions@newhorizonswellness.com
>
> [Edit Information] button (greyed out with tooltip: "Available after verification")

**Marcus's Thoughts:**
- *"The phone is still wrong. At least I can see what they have."*
- *"I can't edit yet, but they said 1-2 days. I'll flag the phone number when the Ambassador calls."*

---

**Section 4: Profile Completion Meter**

A visual progress indicator:

> **Profile Completion: 25%**
> [█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]
>
> Complete your profile to stand out to families searching for treatment.

**Completion Checklist:**
- [x] Basic contact information
- [ ] Facility photos (0 of 5 recommended)
- [ ] Treatment programs offered
- [ ] Insurance plans accepted
- [ ] Staff and credentials
- [ ] Amenities and features
- [ ] Reviews (0)

**Marcus's Thoughts:**
- *"25%—that's low. But it's also motivation. I want to be at 100%."*
- *"5 photos recommended. I should get some good shots of the facility."*
- *"Reviews at 0. That's my biggest gap compared to competitors."*

---

**Section 5: Subscription & Account Details**

> **Your Plan: Free Listing**
> - Basic facility profile
> - Inclusion in search results
> - Lead notifications to admissions email
>
> [View Premium Features] — *Learn how to boost visibility*

**Marcus's Thoughts:**
- *"Good, I'm on the free tier. I can upgrade later if this works."*
- *"I'll check premium features eventually, but not today."*

---

**Section 6: Settings & Help**

Quick links:
- Account Settings (email, password, notification preferences)
- Help Center / FAQs
- Contact Support
- Manage Team Members (add colleagues)

**Marcus's Thoughts:**
- *"I should add my admissions director as a team member so she can update things too."*

---

**Section 7: Next Steps — Build Your Profile**

A clear CTA section at the bottom:

> **Ready to stand out?**
> While you wait for verification, prepare content to make your profile shine:
>
> **1. Gather Facility Photos**
> High-quality images of your facility help families visualize care. We recommend:
> - Exterior/entrance
> - Common areas
> - Patient rooms
> - Outdoor spaces
> - Group therapy rooms
>
> **2. Collect Reviews**
> Reviews build trust. After verification, you'll get tools to request reviews from past clients.
>
> **3. Write Your Story**
> Prepare descriptions of:
> - Your treatment philosophy
> - Programs and specialties
> - Staff credentials
> - What makes you different

**Marcus's Thoughts:**
- *"This is helpful. I can get my marketing person to pull together photos while I wait."*
- *"Write your story—I should draft something about our trauma-informed approach."*
- *"Reviews after verification. Makes sense."*

---

### Step 5: Understanding Profile Completion

**What Increases Profile Completion:**

| Element | Completion Value | Status |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Basic contact info | 15% | Done |
| Verified claim | 10% | Pending |
| Facility description | 10% | Not started |
| Treatment programs | 10% | Not started |
| Insurance accepted | 10% | Not started |
| Photos (5+) | 15% | Not started |
| Staff/credentials | 10% | Not started |
| Amenities | 5% | Not started |
| Reviews (1+) | 15% | Not started |

**Marcus's Thoughts:**
- *"So I need reviews for that last 15%. That's the hardest part."*
- *"Once verified, I can probably get to 70-80% in an afternoon."*
- *"100% profiles probably rank better in search. Worth the effort."*

---

### Step 6: Post-Verification Dashboard Changes

**After the Provider Ambassador approves the claim (1-2 days later):**

> **Congratulations! Your center is now claimed.**
> Families searching for treatment can now see your verified profile.
>
> [Edit Profile] [View Live Listing] [Request Reviews]

**New Capabilities Unlocked:**
- Edit all facility information
- Upload photos
- Add/remove insurance plans
- Write custom descriptions
- Respond to reviews
- Access lead analytics

**Marcus's Thoughts:**
- *"Finally! Let me fix that phone number first."*
- *"View Live Listing—I want to see exactly what families see."*
- *"Request Reviews—I'm sending that link to three families today."*

---

### Step 7: Understanding the Dashboard Sections

**After Verification, Sections He'd Explore (In Order):**

1. **Profile/Listing Management**
   - *"What do families see? How do I control it?"*

2. **Reviews**
   - *"We have none. How do I get them? Can I ask families to review us?"*
   - *"If we get a bad review, can I respond?"*

3. **Leads/Inquiries**
   - *"Are families contacting us through this platform? How do I see those?"*
   - *"Do inquiries come via email, phone, or a dashboard inbox?"*

4. **Analytics**
   - *"How many people are viewing our listing?"*
   - *"What searches are we showing up in?"*

5. **Advertising/Upgrades (last)**
   - *"What do paid features cost?"*
   - *"I'll look at this after I see organic performance."*

---

## Key Emotions Throughout the Journey

| Stage | Emotion | Driver |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Finding listing with wrong info | Frustration, urgency | *"Families are seeing incorrect info"* |
| Discovering claim process | Cautious optimism | *"Hopefully this is straightforward"* |
| Account creation | Impatience | *"Just let me fix the phone number"* |
| First dashboard view | Curiosity + mild overwhelm | *"What do I focus on first?"* |
| Editing profile | Relief (if easy), frustration (if clunky) | *"Finally, I can fix this"* |
| Exploring features | Interest tempered by budget concerns | *"What's this going to cost me?"* |

---

## Conversion Barriers

### What Would Make Him Abandon the Process

| Barrier | Severity | Why It's a Problem |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Requiring sales call before dashboard access** | Critical | *"I don't have time for a sales pitch right now"* |
| **Credit card required for free account** | High | *"You said it's free to list. Why do you need my card?"* |
| **Slow verification (days/weeks)** | High | *"Families are seeing wrong info while I wait"* |
| **Unclear what's free vs. paid** | Medium | *"I don't want surprises"* |
| **No immediate edit access** | Medium | *"If I can't fix anything, what's the point of claiming?"* |
| **Complex, feature-heavy dashboard** | Medium | *"I just want to update our listing, not learn a new platform"* |
| **Aggressive upselling on first login** | Medium | *"Let me see value before you sell to me"* |

---

## Recommended Portal UX for First-Time Users

### Welcome Dashboard Structure (Post-Enrollment)

**Above the Fold:**
1. **Welcome message** — Personalized with facility name
2. **Benefits of Recovery.com** — 4 key value props (leads, profile, control, nationwide search)
3. **Next steps banner** — "A Provider Ambassador is reviewing your claim"

**Below the Fold:**
4. **Profile completion meter** — Visual percentage with checklist
5. **Data on file** — Contact info, subscription tier, quick settings access
6. **Build your profile CTA** — Photos, reviews, custom content preparation

### Key UX Principles
- **Sell the value immediately** — Benefits before features
- **Set clear expectations** — Provider Ambassador process with timeline
- **Show progress** — Profile completion percentage motivates action
- **Enable preparation** — Let them gather content while awaiting verification
- **No dead ends** — Even pre-verification, there's something useful to do

### Dashboard Design Principles
- **Progressive disclosure** — Show simple view first, advanced features on demand
- **Contextual upsells** — "Want more visibility? Learn about Featured Listings" (not modal popups)
- **Mobile-friendly** — Marcus might check this on his phone between sessions
- **Clear status indicators** — Claim pending, verified, profile % complete

## Summary

**Marcus's Ideal Experience:**
> "I found my facility listed with wrong information. In under 10 minutes, I claimed the listing, verified my ownership via a phone call, fixed the critical errors, and uploaded a couple photos. The dashboard is clean and shows me exactly what families see. I can request reviews from past clients and I'll be notified when inquiries come in. The free tier does everything I need right now—I'll consider advertising once I see how organic traffic performs."

**What Makes or Breaks This Experience:**

| Make | Break |
|------|-------|
| Fast verification | Multi-day approval wait |
| Immediate edit access | Changes stuck in review queue |
| Clear free tier value | Hidden paywalls |
| Guided onboarding | Feature overload |
| Transparent pricing | Surprise sales calls |

**Conversion Likelihood:**
- **If experience matches expectations:** 9/10 (claims listing, completes profile)
- **If blocked by sales process:** 2/10 (abandons, tries competitor directory)
